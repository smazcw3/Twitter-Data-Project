# Twitter-Data-Summarization-Visualization

## Problem 1: Study response to an event

We are interested in finding out how the nation, for example, United States reacted to the twitter search keyword or hashtag.
This involves using Search API to get the tweets, group them by geo-location as in Google maps API (one more API) and plot them on the map of the nation in order to visually understanding the response to an event associated with the search keyword.

## Problem 2: Summarizing trending topics about a location (place)

When we are visiting places (say, for an interview or other official visits) you may want to about topics trending in that place. Instead of reading newspapers and online news, you want just a quick summary. As an input if we provide the location specified either as geo-location or by its name then we will get an output as a message listing the topics trending about the place.
